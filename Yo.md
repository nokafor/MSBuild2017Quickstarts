# Build Your First Office Integration

## Overview
With Office Add-ins, you can add new functionality to Office and embed your rich and interactive content. In this walk through, you will get hands-on experience developing an Excel add-in with Yo Office. Your final add-in will be able to write data to a workbook and apply basic formatting, as well as bound a chart to that data. If you would instead like to create an add-in using Visual Studio, see Building Your First Office Integration with Visual Studio.
